# Rayscan AI: Medical Imaging and Diagnosis in Lungs Using AI/ML
Diagnose diseases like Pneumonia, COVID-19, Tuberculosis and Normal lungs conditions using VGGNet, ResNet and InceptionNet.

**Rayscan AI** : It is a deep learning-based medical imaging project that detects lung diseases such as **Pneumonia**, **COVID-19**, **Tuberculosis**, and identifies **Normal** cases from chest X-ray images. It uses powerful convolutional neural network architectures like **VGGNet**, **ResNet**, and **InceptionNet** to assist in accurate and early diagnosis.

## ü©∫ Project Objectives
- Detect and classify chest X-rays into:
  - COVID-19
  - Pneumonia
  - Tuberculosis
  - Normal (no disease detected)
- Provide an intelligent diagnostic tool to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals.
- Explore and compare deep learning models for medical imaging.

## üß† Models Used
- ‚úÖ VGGNet
- ‚úÖ ResNet (e.g., ResNet50 or ResNet152)
- ‚úÖ InceptionNet (e.g., InceptionV3)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV for image preprocessing
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for performance metrics

## üìä Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion matrix for class-wise performance

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Streamlit or Flask web app for real-time prediction
- Model ensemble for improved accuracy
- Integration with hospital databases or PACS
- Support for CT scans in addition to X-rays

## üìå How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
